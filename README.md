Swap high source images into web pages

Determines whether a given images being rendered into a web page is of good enough quality for it’s current display size/resolution and, if not, seeks a high resolution version of the image.

# 1 Find out  better images when…
- The **page zoom** is >100% (replaces all images in a page)
- An image is rendered bigger than the source (checks each image)
# 2 Get the best image
I’ve had some difficulty finding the source code for the image seeking but I’m pretty sure the hover-zoom Chrome plugin source is available.

# Defining a standard
As Jim Purbrick suggested, efforts could be made to document a standard way of referencing high res images. There might already be a standard, don’t know.
